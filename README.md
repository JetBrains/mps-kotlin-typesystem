# Type system for MPS kotlin
This repository contains an implementation of the kotlin type system to be used with the kotlin language in MPS.
The implementation relies on [MPS coderules](https://github.com/jetbrains/mps-coderules).

## Requirements
The project requires a version of MPS bundling kotlin (not available currently, more details in the future) with
the codesrules plugins (please refer to [coderules readme](https://github.com/jetbrains/mps-coderules) for instructions).

## Structure of the project
More details to come :)
